# LinkedLists
For the following use the code for linked lists provided in linkedlist.py.

1. Implement a getter and a setter for the data in the node class. Make sure to use the property decorator from the why video (the code is in whypart2.py in that video).<br>
2. Create a stack class, which inherits the linked list class and adds a pop method. <br>
   Use the SS class in social.py to create 7 valid social security numbers and push them to the stack. Print the stack. Pop each SS# from the stack, print the entire stack with each pop.
3. Create a queue class which inherits the linked list class and adds a pop method. <br>
   Use my social security class code from the regexes activity to create 7 valid social security numbers and push them to the queue. Print the queue. Pop each SS# from the queue, print the entire queue with each pop.
4. Create a method delete for the linked list class that removes an element with a certain value. <br>
   def delete(self, x):
   Use my social security class code from the regexes activity to create 7 valid social security numbers and push them to the list. Make the middle number "324-12-3333". Print the list and then use your delete function to remove it, print the list again. <br>
